		<h1>Expansion</h1>
		The value of the sequence 1 is 1.<br>
		First, to expand a sequence S in amognus us notation, split it into parts, before elements whose value is equal to their position. 
		Then, for each sub-sequence, reduce the first element until it is 1. 
		Reduce the rest of the elements in the sub-sequence by the same amount you reduced the first element by.<br><br>

		If there's multiple sub-sequences, the value of S is equal to the sum of the values of the subsequences.
		However, this isn't enough for sequences with only a single sub-sequence.
		In that case, do this:

		<ul>
			<li>
				Remove the last element, add 1, and call that F.
			</li>
			<li>
				Group the sequence into "blocks", which are sequences of the same number.
			</li>
		</ul>

		Next, scan right to left by block. 
		Do this until the amount of numbers "scanned" &GreaterEqual; F - what number the current block is made of.
		Once you stop, take all of the scanned blocks, and call them &Delta;S. Let &Delta; be F - what number the leftmost block is made of.<br><br>

		With &Delta; and &Delta;S, we can define the FS of the sequence. 
		S[1] = &Delta;S. S[n+1] = S[n] concatenated to &Delta;S with each element increased by &Delta; * S. 
		And the value of S is sup{S[n] | n &lt; &omega;}.<br><br>

		I made a googology site for incredibly shitty notations, I guess.
		There's not much yet though, because everything else that I made are array notations from 6th grade and a terribly defined OCF.
		I'm not saying "amognus us notation" is much better, though.
		It's not.<br><br>

		also shut up i know this looks ugly, i only spent 5 minutes on css<br>

		<h1>Stuff I made</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="amognus/index.html">amognus us notation.</a>
				It's an ordinal notation. 
				There are only expansion rules right now. 
				Expander thing later, maybe.
				It's quite weak, I think the limit is just &phi;(&omega;, 0) (assuming 1,0 and such to not be allowed).
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="ocf/index.html">An attempt an an "OCF".</a> 
				It's an ordinal notation, again. 
				Probably ill-defined. 
				I should probably make some sort of standardness / validity / comparison checker.
				It also isn't an OCF, and is just strings instead of real ordinals.
			</li>
			<li>
				nothing else because im lazy

		I made a googology site for incredibly shitty notations, I guess.
		There's not much yet though, because everything else that I made are array notations from 6th grade and a terribly defined OCF.
		I'm not saying "amognus us notation" is much better, though.
		It's not.<br><br>

		also shut up i know this looks ugly, i only spent 5 minutes on css<br>

		<h1>Stuff I made</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="amognus/index.html">amognus us notation</a>. It's an ordinal notation. There are only expansion rules right now. Expander thing later, maybe.
			</li>
			<li>
				nothing else because im lazy
			</li>
		</ul>
